# Azurite McProxy

Azurite McProxy is a secure intermediary layer that helps you connect to Minecraft servers safely and privately. When using this proxy, your real IP address will never be exposed ‚Äì instead, the server will only see the proxy‚Äôs IP.

# üìÉRequirements

```
- python 3.8+
- Port forwarding
- Potato pc
```

# ‚ö° Install

## Step 1 download Azurite-McProxy:

using:
```git clone https://github.com/Notkenftr/Azurite-McProxy```

## Step 2 config

The azurite.yml file is where you configure all proxy settings. Below is a detailed explanation of each field:
```yaml
forward:
  listen_address: 0.0.0.0   # Address the proxy will listen on.

  listen_port: 25565        # Port where the proxy listens (your Minecraft client connects here)

  server-address: 123.45.67.89  # Real Minecraft server address (the proxy forwards traffic here)
  server-port: 25565            # Real Minecraft server port

  buffer-size: 128              # Buffer size (KB) for forwarding data
                                # - 64  = 64KB  (lighter, uses less RAM)
                                # - 128 = 128KB (recommended, balanced)
                                # - 256 = 256KB (faster, higher RAM usage)

```
Example Setup

Forwarding to the real server play.hypixel.net, port 25565
```yaml
forward:
  listen_address: 0.0.0.0
  listen_port: 25566

  server-address: play.hypixel.net
  server-port: 25565

  buffer-size: 128
```


# Setup Guide: Running Proxy & Connecting from Minecraft


## Preparation

1. Make sure the file proxy.py is ready and the proxy port is configured (e.g., 9999 or 25565).

2. Install Python (usually python3).

3. If running on a VPS/home server, open the proxy port in the firewall/router (if needed).

##  1. Run the Proxy
Open a terminal on the machine where the proxy will run, go to the folder containing proxy.py, then execute:
```bash
# Linux / macOS
python3 proxy.py

# Windows (if Python is bound to the command "python")
python proxy.py

```

After running, the console should show something like:
```
[Azurite] Listening on 0.0.0.0:xxxx ‚Üí 192.168.1.100:xxxx
```

If you don‚Äôt see this, check for errors such as bind failure / Address already in use / missing permissions.

## 2. Get Proxy IP & Port


Find public IP if the client is connecting from the internet:

- On the proxy machine: curl ifconfig.me or visit a site like whatismyip.

Port = proxy listening port (e.g., 25562).

Example server address:

```
203.0.113.5:25562

```

If the proxy runs behind a router (home VPS), remember to set up port forwarding: ``public_port ‚Üí internal_ip:proxy_port``.

## 3. Add Server in Minecraft (Client)

- Open Minecraft ‚Üí go to Multiplayer.
- Click **Add Server** (or Direct Connect if you want to join immediately).
- Server Name: set any name (e.g., ‚ÄúAzurite Proxy‚Äù).
- Server Address: enter IP:PORT (e.g., 203.0.113.5:9999).
   - If the port is 25565 (default), you can just enter the IP.
- Save ‚Üí select the server ‚Üí Play / Join Server.

# Troubleshooting

## A. If Minecraft disconnects instantly
- Try increasing ``BUFFER_SIZE`` (e.g., 128KB) to reduce packet split issues.

- Check if proxy is forwarding properly in both directions.

- Verify the real server (target_host:target_port) is online.

## B. Check log proxy

- When a client connects, the proxy console should show:
```
Incoming connection from ('client_ip', 41123)
[C‚ÜíS] Forwarded 256 bytes
[S‚ÜíC] Forwarded 1024 bytes
```
- If you don‚Äôt see logs:
  -  The proxy may not be working, please check the setup steps again.
